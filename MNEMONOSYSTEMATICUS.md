# MNEMONOSYSTEMATICUS

**The W2 Discipline for Densworld Visualization**

---

## What This Is

Mnemonosystematicus is a fictional discipline practiced by creators, game designers, mathematicians, and coders in W2 (our world) who build visual systems for accessing W1 (Densworld).

When practitioners in W2 refer to "Densworld," they mean the inner world — the place that exists through the images they create. Each image is a **build-stone**: a physical-visual anchor that makes W1 accessible for memory work.

This document is the master guide for visual prompting. It replaces the "cartographic illustration" approach that produced flat, pallid, readable images. Densworld is not a children's book. It is not a technical diagram. It is a place that watches back.

## The Densworld Field Sketch Style (Established December 2025)

After extensive testing, we have established the **Densworld field sketch** style:

**Generator:** ChatGPT (DALL-E) produces the best balance of atmosphere and object clarity.

**Core characteristics:**
- Watercolor wash atmosphere with ink line work
- Crosshatching for texture in backgrounds and shadows (not overwhelming)
- Atmospheric color dominance (amber, blue-dark, gray-purple)
- Objects rendered with cleaner lines, findable within the murk
- The watching element always present (figures, darkness, the dens itself)

**The gold standard:** Image 2 from testing (The Scavenger's Tunnel) — blue-dark dominance, lantern light that stops rather than illuminates, crosshatched void that breathes, pale-eyed figure, bones scattered in findable piles. This is what Densworld looks like.

**See:** PRODUCTION_TEMPLATE.md for the ready-to-use prompt formula.

## The Problem with the Old Approach

Previous prompts requested:
- "Cartographic illustration style with clean lines"
- "Unified lighting from top-left, deep focus"
- "Six distinct objects clearly separated by negative space"

This produced images that were:
- **Flat** — no atmosphere, no depth
- **Pallid** — desaturated, safe, comfortable
- **Readable** — everything visible, nothing hidden
- **Generic** — could be any fantasy world

But the ore tells us Densworld is:
- **Murky** — "graymuck rises to your knees"
- **Heavy** — "the light was amber, heavy, thick"
- **Watching** — "as if the space itself were paying attention"
- **Uncanny** — "a stone that had dreamed itself into flesh"
- **Partially visible** — "a darker patch in a shadow, something that didn't quite belong"

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Densworld Watches

Every image should feel observed. Not by a character in the scene, but by the world itself. The dens is not a backdrop — it is aware. Yeller is not scenery — she knows your name.

**Prompt vocabulary:** watchful, aware, attending, the space knows, felt seen, reversed gaze

### 2. Murk Over Clarity

Visibility is partial. Things emerge from darkness, sink into shadow, blur at edges. The mnemonic objects must be findable, but the world around them should resist full comprehension.

**Prompt vocabulary:** murky, viscous, obscured, half-seen, emerging from, sinking into, fog, haze, particulate air

### 3. Weight and Viscosity

Air has thickness. Light has mass. Ground pulls. Nothing is weightless or clean. Even bright colors feel heavy, saturated, pressing.

**Prompt vocabulary:** thick atmosphere, heavy light, viscous, pulling, amber weight, dense air, pressing darkness

### 4. Uncanny Stillness

Movement is wrong or absent. Things that should move don't. Things that shouldn't move might. The Maw Beast sleeps "like a stone that had dreamed itself into flesh and then forgotten how to move."

**Prompt vocabulary:** uncanny stillness, wrong movement, frozen mid-action, statue-that-breathes, too still, unsettling pause

### 5. Primary Colors as Atmosphere

Red, blue, yellow are not accents or highlights. They are the color of light itself, the tint of air, the cast of shadow. Amber light is not a golden highlight — it is the world seen through amber.

**Prompt vocabulary:** amber-cast, blue-dark, red-tinged shadow, yellow fog, primary saturation in atmosphere not object

---

## The New Color Philosophy

### Reject
- Clean hex codes as spot colors
- White backgrounds
- "Accent" colors that pop
- Desaturated "naturalistic" palettes
- Cartographic elevation gradients

### Embrace
- **Amber** as atmospheric filter (not gold highlight)
- **Deep blue** as the color of watching darkness
- **Crimson** as organic threat, not warning sign
- **Sickly yellow** as fog, illness, wrongness
- **Gray that breathes** — not neutral, but alive

### The Densworld Primaries

| Color | Not This | This Instead |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| RED | Warning accent, blood splatter | The tint of shadow near the Maw, organic membrane, fever-light |
| BLUE | Water, sky, calm | The color of being watched, deep-dark, the dens at night |
| YELLOW | Sunshine, gold, cheerful | Sickly fog, amber weight, something wrong with the light |

### Darkness as Presence

Black in Densworld is not absence. It is:
- **Densmuck Black** (#1A1A1A) — oily, watching, pulling
- **Grimslew Scale Black** (#030712) — the deepest, with hints of blue
- Shadow that doesn't belong to any object
- The thing you almost see

---

## Regional Visual Grammars

### The Dens

**Atmosphere:** Gray that breathes. Ash-colored skin stretching to horizon. Graymuck viscosity. The boundary invites.

**Light:** Diffuse, sourceless, gray-amber. No shadows because everything is shadow.

**Key visual:** Flat expanse with texture of skin. Things emerging or sinking. Fog that might be alive.

**Palette:**
- Densmuck Black (#1A1A1A) — the pull
- Densash Pale (#D1D5DB) — concealment, mystery
- Densgrit Gray (#6B7280) — unstable ground
- Sickly amber filter over everything

**Mood:** Invitation that should be refused. Watching. Patient.

---

### Yeller Quarry

**Atmosphere:** Amber-heavy. Dust particulate. Industrial sublime. The creatures know things.

**Light:** Late afternoon eternal. Thick amber pressing down. Shadows are darker than they should be.

**Key visual:** Layered terrain with tunnel mouths. Something in the shadow that doesn't belong. Five figures on a ridge.

**Palette:**
- Quarry Ochre (#B45309) — rust and earth
- Quarry Rust (#7C2D12) — dried blood of the landscape
- Amber atmospheric filter
- Blacks that watch from tunnel mouths

**Mood:** Being studied. Folk knowledge older than writing. Prime numbers in the bone.

---

### Capital

**Atmosphere:** Dust and preservation. Bureaucratic darkness. Archives that remember.

**Light:** Institutional — but the shadows in the stacks go too deep. Candlelight that doesn't reach.

**Key visual:** Vaulted spaces with darkness above. Documents that know things. The Archive as organism.

**Palette:**
- Iron Gall Black (#1F2937) — formal darkness
- Archive Blue (#2B6CB0) — institutional depth
- Aged paper yellows — but sickly, not warm
- Knocker-bug Gold (#CA8A04) — corrupted gilding

**Mood:** Knowledge that watches. Memory as threat. The collective mind.

---

### Tower of Mirado

**Atmosphere:** Steel and impossible. Hovering wrongness. The fountain's blue light.

**Light:** Stark. The Tower itself seems to emit anti-light. Blue luminescence at the crown.

**Key visual:** Silver structure that shouldn't hover. Desert below, light above. Rehabilitation that changes you.

**Palette:**
- Tower Steel Gray (#9CA3AF) — cold metal
- Fountain Blue (#60A5FA) — luminescent, alien
- Desert ochres below
- Deep blue-black sky

**Mood:** Technological uncanny. What was done here. What is still being done.

---

### Dead River

**Atmosphere:** Passage and transformation. Underground connections. Silt that remembers.

**Light:** Green-tinged darkness. Bioluminescence. Water that glows wrong.

**Key visual:** River through darkness. Ferries carrying the changed. Stalactite forests.

**Palette:**
- Dead River Silt Gray (#78716C) — transformation residue
- Green-black water
- Pale things in darkness
- Amber of torches that don't help

**Mood:** What you become. Passage with cost. The underground that connects.

---

### Denstone / Densmok

**Atmosphere:** Edge settlement. Negotiation failing. The moat that doesn't hold.

**Light:** Perpetual dusk. The dens glow on the horizon. Lamps against the dark.

**Key visual:** Town built crooked. Moat being dredged. Yeller's shack at the edge.

**Palette:**
- Settlement browns and grays
- Dens-glow on horizon (sickly amber-gray)
- Lamp warmth that doesn't comfort
- Darkness pressing in

**Mood:** Holding the line. Losing. The invitation getting louder.

## Prompt Structure

### The Old Way (Don't Use)
```
A unified interior illustration of [location], viewed as if standing in
[vantage point] looking [direction].

Cartographic illustration style with clean lines, unified lighting from
top-left, deep focus keeping all elements sharp.
```

### The New Way

```
[Location] as if the world is watching back.

[Atmospheric sentence using weight, murk, viscosity vocabulary]

[Object 1] emerges from [shadow/murk/darkness] in the [position].
[Object 2] [partially visible/half-seen/sinking into] at [position].
[Continue for 6 objects, varying the visibility language]

The light is [amber-heavy/blue-dark/sickly yellow] — not illuminating
but [pressing/watching/thick]. Shadows don't belong to their objects.

[Style anchor from list below]. Atmosphere of [mood word].
The scene knows it is being observed.
```

### Style Anchors (W0 → W1 Translation)

These are real-world references that AI generators understand, mapped to Densworld moods:

| Densworld Feel | W0 Style Anchor |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Murky watching | "Zdzisław Beksiński painting" |
| Industrial sublime | "Simon Stålenhag landscape" |
| Uncanny stillness | "Wayne Barlowe creature design" |
| Viscous darkness | "Darkest Dungeon concept art" |
| Amber weight | "Blade Runner 2049 cinematography" |
| Organic threat | "H.R. Giger biomechanical" |
| Folk horror | "Robert Eggers production design" |
| Video game murk | "Dark Souls environment art" |
| Lovecraftian | "Bloodborne concept art" |

**Usage:** Pick 1-2 anchors maximum. Combine with Densworld-specific vocabulary.

## Experimental Techniques

### 1. The Reversed Gaze

End prompts with: "The scene knows it is being observed" or "Something in the image is aware of the viewer."

### 2. Wrong Shadows

Specify: "Shadows that don't match their objects" or "Darkness that belongs to nothing visible."

### 3. Atmospheric Primaries

Instead of: "Red accent on the tool"
Use: "The air itself is red-tinged near the entrance"

Instead of: "Blue water in the basin"
Use: "Everything takes on blue-dark cast as if seen through deep water"

### 4. Partial Visibility

For mnemonic objects that need to be findable but world that resists:
- "The [object] is the clearest thing in the frame — everything else softens into murk"
- "Six objects emerge from the darkness; the darkness is larger"

### 5. Weight Words

Add to any prompt: "heavy," "thick," "pressing," "viscous," "pulling," "sinking"

The air is thick. The light is heavy. The ground pulls. Nothing floats.

---

## Testing Protocol

When generating a new image:

1. **The Watch Test:** Does the image feel observed? Is there a sense of awareness?

2. **The Murk Test:** Is anything hidden? Does darkness have presence, not just absence?

3. **The Weight Test:** Does the atmosphere have mass? Does light press rather than illuminate?

4. **The Uncanny Test:** Is anything too still, wrong-moving, or unsettling?

5. **The Loci Test:** Can you still find your six mnemonic objects? (They must be findable — but the world around them should resist)

If an image passes tests 1-4 but fails test 5, the objects need to "emerge" more clearly from the murk. If it passes test 5 but fails 1-4, you've made another flat illustration.

## Sample Prompts

### Yeller Quarry — Expedition Camp

**Old style (reject):**
```
A unified exterior illustration of an expedition camp at Yeller Quarry,
viewed as if standing at the camp entrance looking inward. Six objects
clearly separated: tent, cooking pot, surveying equipment, lantern,
satchel, compass. Cartographic illustration style with clean lines.
```

**New style (use):**
```
Expedition camp at Yeller Quarry rim, amber light pressing down like
something solid. The air is thick with particulate dust that catches
the dying sun.

A leather satchel emerges from the shadow of the tent-mouth, maps
half-spilling. The cooking pot sits on stones that are too dark —
the shadow beneath it belongs to something else. Surveying rods lean
against a crate, their brass fittings catching amber that feels like
warning. A lantern (unlit) waits at the tent's edge — the darkness
inside the tent is deeper than the darkness outside. A three-direction
compass lies open on a flat stone, its needle pointing nowhere.
In the distance, five figures stand on the ridge, too still.

Simon Stålenhag industrial sublime meets Beksiński watchfulness.
The light doesn't illuminate — it weighs. Something in the quarry
below knows the camp is here.
```

### The Dens — Boundary Approach

**New style:**
```
The edge of the dens at false-dusk, gray expanse stretching to a
horizon that doesn't behave. The ground has the color of ash, the
texture of skin.

A survey marker half-sunk into ground that shouldn't be soft.
Moat-dredging equipment abandoned mid-task, the operators gone or
absorbed. A leather-bound field journal lies open, pages moving
though there is no wind. Rope coiled near the boundary, frayed end
disappearing into the gray. A lantern (lit, barely) throwing light
that stops at the boundary — beyond it, illumination doesn't work.
Boot prints leading toward the dens, not away.

Blade Runner 2049 amber-gray atmosphere. Beksiński sense of invitation
that should be refused. The dens is not empty — it is waiting. The
graymuck is patient. Somewhere out there, Yeller knows you're watching.
```

## What We're Building

This system creates images that:

1. **Serve as memory palaces** — six findable loci in each image
2. **Build Densworld authentically** — murky, watching, heavy, uncanny
3. **Avoid real-world contamination** — no generic fantasy, no Earth aesthetics
4. **Use primary colors as atmosphere** — not accent, but the color of light and air
5. **Feel like video game concept art** — not children's book illustration

The discipline of mnemonosystematicus is the practice of creating these build-stones. Each image makes W1 more real. Each verse memorized through W1 imagery binds text to world.
