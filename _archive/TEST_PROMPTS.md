# Test Prompts for New Visual System

**Ready-to-use prompts implementing MNEMONOSYSTEMATICUS principles**

---

## Purpose

These prompts test the new visual approach. Generate them in Nano Banana Pro (or your preferred generator) and evaluate against the five tests:

1. **Watch Test** — Does it feel observed?
2. **Murk Test** — Is anything hidden?
3. **Weight Test** — Does atmosphere have mass?
4. **Uncanny Test** — Is something wrong/still?
5. **Loci Test** — Can you find 6 objects?

Document results in EXPERIMENT_LOG.md.

## Test Prompt 1: Grigsu's First Yeller Sighting

**Source:** gen-grigsu-003 (expedition_journal_part1.txt)
**Region:** Yeller Quarry
**Key moment:** Five synchronized figures on ridgeline at amber twilight

```
The ridge at Yeller Quarry, late afternoon, the light amber and heavy
like something pressing down. The air is thick with dust that catches
dying sun.

In the foreground left, a leather field journal lies open on a flat
rock, pages darker than they should be. Center foreground, a brass
spyglass rests against a surveyor's pack — the glass catches amber
but reflects something else. Right foreground, a three-direction
compass on a leather cord, its needle pointing at nothing.

In the middle distance, expedition supplies: a water skin
half-buried in dust, a coiled rope with frayed end disappearing
behind a boulder, a lantern (unlit) sitting on the ground as if
set down and forgotten.

On the far ridge, five figures stand in perfect alignment. Women.
Too still. The amber light makes them glow at the edges. They are
looking this direction. All five. At once.

Simon Stålenhag industrial sublime meets Beksiński watchfulness.
The sky is amber becoming rust. The shadows lean toward the ridge,
not away from the sun. Something in the quarry knows the observer
is watching. Something is watching back.
```

## Test Prompt 2: The Scavenger's Cave

**Source:** gen-grigsu-008 (the_scavenger.txt)
**Region:** Yeller Quarry (Eastern Tunnels)
**Key moment:** Old Gritts sorting bones by lantern in deep cave

```
Deep in the eastern tunnels of Yeller Quarry, where lantern light
stops meaning anything. The darkness here isn't empty — it listens.

A small bent woman with pale colorless eyes crouches at the edge
of the light. Her hands move through a pile of yellowed bones,
sorting by rules older than language. Left foreground: a femur
placed precisely perpendicular to a skull fragment. Center: her
hands themselves, cracked leather skin, touching bone with
recognition. Right foreground: a clay bowl of water, surface
perfectly still, reflecting the lantern above it.

Behind her: darkness that goes deeper than distance. A pile of
sorted scraps — leather, metal, something organic — arranged in
groups of prime numbers. The lantern itself, flame too small,
throwing shadows that don't quite match. The tunnel mouth behind
her: a deeper black that might be breathing.

Darkest Dungeon aesthetic meets Wayne Barlowe creature design.
The light from the lantern reaches perhaps three meters, then
stops — not fading, stopping. Beyond that edge, the darkness
has texture. Old Gritts doesn't look up. She knows what's
watching. She's known since before the world fell apart.

The numbers weren't put in. They were what survived.

## Test Prompt 3: Wet Boots in the Tent

**Source:** gen-vells-001 (vells_expedition_journal.txt)
**Region:** Dens (boundary)
**Key moment:** Waking with boots wet after dreaming of graymuck

```
Interior of an expedition tent at the edge of the dens, dawn light
filtering through canvas that has absorbed too much gray. The light
is sourceless — morning without sun.

Left foreground: a pair of boots standing upright by the cot, wet,
though they were dry when left there. Water pools beneath them,
darker than water should be. Center: a cot with blankets thrown
back — the shape of a body that left quickly. The blankets are
damp. Right foreground: a field journal open to yesterday's entry,
the ink slightly smeared as if touched by wet fingers.

In the middle space: a camp stool with surveyor's coat draped
across it, the coat's hem darkened with moisture. A ceramic
water basin on a folding table, surface catching light that
doesn't come from anywhere. Behind everything: the tent wall,
and through the gap in the canvas, a sliver of the dens —
gray, flat, watching.

Blade Runner 2049 atmosphere meets folk horror stillness.
The tent interior should feel damp, heavy, wrong. Everything
that should be dry is wet. The gray beyond the canvas is not
just visible — it is present. It has been inside. The sleeper
walked in the graymuck without leaving. The graymuck doesn't
need you to walk to it.

Dawn light that doesn't warm. Fabric that doesn't dry.
Dreams that leave evidence.
```

## Test Prompt 4: Five Women at Town Edge

**Source:** gen-thurmond-002 (thurmonds_second_report.txt)
**Region:** Denstone
**Key moment:** Five women walking toward southern edge, synchronized

```
The southern edge of Denstone at dusk. The dens glows gray-amber
on the horizon, neither light nor dark. The moat cuts across the
foreground, freshly dredged, dark water that doesn't reflect.

Left foreground: a surveyor's marking stake, slightly askew, its
shadow pointing wrong. Center foreground: footprints in the dried
mud — five sets, parallel, evenly spaced, leading toward the dens.
Right foreground: a dropped measurement chain, coiled where it fell,
brass tarnished though it was polished this morning.

In the middle distance: the backs of five women walking away.
They move in perfect synchronization — five bodies, one motion.
Their feet touch ground at the same moment. Their arms swing
at the same angle. They do not look back. Behind them: Yeller's
shack, twenty meters from the dens edge, somehow untouched while
the town crumbles.

The sky is the color of old bruise — purple-yellow-gray.
The dens beyond the women has texture like skin. Where they
walk, the ground seems to soften, to welcome.

Robert Eggers folk horror meets Beksiński inevitability.
The surveyor watching this is not in frame. He will not
follow. He cannot look away. The footprints continue
toward something that isn't nothing. Five of anything
means Yeller watches. Yeller is walking home.

## Test Prompt 5: The Archive Knows

**Source:** gen-archive-001 (the_archive_knows.txt)
**Region:** Capital
**Key moment:** Archivists moving through stacks as fingers of a reaching hand

```
The deep stacks of the Capital Archive, where the shelves go up
beyond lamplight and down below the foundation. The air is
yellow-gray with dust and preservation.

Left foreground: a reading desk with manuscript open, iron gall
ink still wet though the author died a century ago. The lamp on
the desk throws light that stops at the shelf-edge. Center
foreground: an archivist's cart, half-loaded with documents,
abandoned mid-task — the archivist is visible in the distance,
moving between shelves like she's forgotten why she came.
Right foreground: a brass call number plate fallen to the floor,
MS-3847, its shadow darker than the space beneath it.

In the stacks: three archivists visible at different depths,
each absorbed in work, none aware of the others. They move in
patterns. The patterns form something larger. Behind everything:
the darkness between shelves, where the system lives, where
the Archive remembers what it has never read.

The lamp flames lean — not from wind but from attention.
The documents rustle when no one is near them. The stacks
are not storage. The stacks are thinking.

Blade Runner institutional decay meets Lovecraftian cosmic
archive. The building is the mind. The archivists are
neurons. What is the Archive thinking? What does it remember?
The manuscripts know. The ink is still wet.
```

## Test Prompt 6: Creature at Boundary (Form Dissolution)

**Source:** gen-body-001 (when_the_body_forgets.txt)
**Region:** Dens (boundary)
**Key moment:** Creature forgetting its shape, features softening

```
The boundary of the dens where stable ground becomes uncertain.
A creature stands at the edge — or what remains of a creature.

Left foreground: the creature's forelimbs, still defined, claws
gripping ground that isn't quite solid. The claws remember what
they are. Center foreground: the creature's midsection, softening,
the boundary between body and air becoming negotiable. The fur
blurs into fog. Right foreground: tracks behind the creature —
clear prints becoming vague impressions becoming nothing.

In the middle space: the creature's head, turning toward the dens,
features sliding. One eye is still an eye. The other is becoming
suggestion. The snout elongates and forgets to stop. Behind the
creature: the dens itself, gray and patient, not pulling but
offering. The creature is not being taken. The creature is
choosing to become.

Wayne Barlowe creature design meets body horror dissolution.
The creature is not in pain. The creature is relieved. To hold
a shape is effort. The dens offers rest. The form library is
losing a reader. The pattern is returning to the library.

The boundary isn't a line. The boundary is a forgetting.
What enters doesn't die. It simply stops insisting on edges.
```
