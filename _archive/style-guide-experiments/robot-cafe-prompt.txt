Urban sketch style: Late-night café terrace, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from a single electric lamp, heavy shadows dominating the scene, empty tables except for one elderly figure hunched over his glass, tree branches casting web-like shadows across the space, muted watercolor palette of deep blues and blacks with one warm yellow glow from the café window, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of night and solitude, loose brushstrokes emphasizing the vacant chairs and untouched tables, architectural details fading into darkness at the edges. Do NOT include any signature.
