# Urban Sketch Style Tests with Ore-Derived Content

**Testing the "urban sketch" style breakthrough with actual Densworld scenes**

---

## The Formula

From the successful experiments:

```
Urban sketch style: [Scene description], predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from [light source], heavy shadows in [atmospheric color] dominating the scene, [key figure/element], [environmental detail creating texture], muted watercolor palette of [color range] with [single intense glow], rough crosshatching suggesting [mood/weight], loose brushstrokes emphasizing [key visual elements], [edges/details] fading into darkness at the edges.
```

## Test Prompt 1: Grigsu's First Yeller Sighting

**Source:** gen-grigsu-003
**Key moment:** Five synchronized figures on ridgeline at amber twilight

```
Urban sketch style: Ridge at Yeller Quarry at dusk, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from dying amber sun, heavy shadows in rust-red dominating the rocky terrain, five women standing in perfect alignment on the far ridge — too still, too synchronized, tree-like silhouettes of surveying equipment in foreground casting web-like shadows across flat stone, muted watercolor palette of deep ambers and blacks with one intense ochre glow where sun touches the five figures, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of being watched, loose brushstrokes emphasizing the empty expedition camp below the ridge, geological details fading into darkness at the edges. The five figures are looking this direction. All at once.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Field journal on flat rock (foreground left)
2. Brass spyglass against pack (foreground center)
3. Three-direction compass on cord (foreground right)
4. Water skin half-buried (middle)
5. Coiled rope with frayed end (middle)
6. Unlit lantern on ground (middle)

## Test Prompt 2: The Scavenger's Tunnel

**Source:** gen-grigsu-008
**Key moment:** Old Gritts sorting bones by lantern in deep cave

```
Urban sketch style: Deep tunnel in eastern Yeller Quarry, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from single oil lantern, heavy shadows in blue-black dominating the cave walls, small bent woman with pale eyes crouching at edge of light sorting yellowed bones, tunnel mouth behind her a deeper darkness that seems to breathe, muted watercolor palette of deep browns and blacks with one weak amber glow from the lantern that stops rather than fades, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of stone and centuries, loose brushstrokes emphasizing piles of sorted scraps arranged in small groups, cave details fading into absolute darkness at the edges. The darkness beyond the lantern light has texture.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Femur placed perpendicular to skull fragment (foreground left)
2. Old woman's cracked leather hands touching bone (foreground center)
3. Clay bowl of still water reflecting lantern (foreground right)
4. Pile of sorted scraps in prime-number groups (middle left)
5. The lantern itself, flame too small (middle center)
6. Tunnel mouth — deeper black (background)

## Test Prompt 3: Wet Boots in the Tent

**Source:** gen-vells-001
**Key moment:** Waking with boots wet after dreaming of graymuck

```
Urban sketch style: Interior of expedition tent at edge of the dens at gray dawn, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from sourceless morning light filtering through canvas, heavy shadows in gray-purple dominating the cramped space, pair of boots standing by cot — wet though they were dry when left — water pooling beneath them darker than water should be, muted watercolor palette of grays and sickly yellows with one pale glow where light fails to warm, rough crosshatching suggesting damp fabric and wrong moisture, loose brushstrokes emphasizing thrown-back blankets and abandoned cot, canvas walls fading into gray at the edges. Through gap in tent flap: a sliver of the dens, flat, watching.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Wet boots with dark pool beneath (foreground left)
2. Cot with thrown-back damp blankets (foreground center)
3. Field journal with smeared ink (foreground right)
4. Camp stool with coat draped, hem darkened (middle left)
5. Ceramic water basin on folding table (middle center)
6. Gap in canvas showing dens sliver (background)

## Test Prompt 4: Five Women Leaving Denstone

**Source:** gen-thurmond-002
**Key moment:** Five women walking toward dens, synchronized

```
Urban sketch style: Southern edge of Denstone at dusk, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from last light on horizon, heavy shadows in purple-gray dominating the scene, five women walking away toward the dens in perfect synchronization — five bodies one motion — their backs to viewer, freshly dredged moat cutting across foreground with dark water that doesn't reflect, muted watercolor palette of bruise-purple and gray-amber with one sick glow where dens meets sky, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of inevitability, loose brushstrokes emphasizing empty footprints leading toward the gray expanse, town details fading into darkness at the edges. Yeller's shack visible near the dens edge, somehow untouched.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Surveyor's marking stake, slightly askew (foreground left)
2. Five sets of parallel footprints in dried mud (foreground center)
3. Dropped measurement chain, brass tarnished (foreground right)
4. The five women's synchronized backs (middle distance)
5. Yeller's shack at dens edge (middle right)
6. The dens itself — gray, skin-textured (background)

## Test Prompt 5: The Archive Stacks

**Source:** gen-archive-001
**Key moment:** Archivists moving through stacks as fingers of reaching hand

```
Urban sketch style: Deep stacks of Capital Archive where shelves go up beyond lamplight, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from desk lamp that stops at shelf-edge, heavy shadows in institutional blue-black dominating the vertical space, three archivists visible at different depths moving in patterns they don't recognize, reading desk with manuscript open — ink still wet though author died a century ago, muted watercolor palette of dust-yellow and deep blue with one confined amber glow from lamp that doesn't spread, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of accumulated knowledge, loose brushstrokes emphasizing abandoned cart and fallen call number plate, upper shelves fading into absolute darkness. The stacks are thinking.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Reading desk with wet-ink manuscript (foreground left)
2. Desk lamp throwing light that stops (foreground center)
3. Fallen brass call number plate MS-3847 (foreground right)
4. Archivist's cart half-loaded, abandoned (middle left)
5. Archivist in distance, absorbed, unaware (middle)
6. Darkness between shelves where system lives (background)

## Test Prompt 6: Creature Forgetting Its Shape

**Source:** gen-body-001
**Key moment:** Creature at dens boundary, form dissolving

```
Urban sketch style: Boundary of the dens where solid ground becomes uncertain, predominantly dark ink with sparse highlights from sourceless gray light, heavy shadows in gray-green dominating the dissolving terrain, creature standing at edge — forelimbs still defined with claws gripping uncertain ground, midsection softening where boundary between body and air becomes negotiable, muted watercolor palette of ash-gray and sickly pale with no warm glow anywhere, rough crosshatching suggesting the weight of form trying to hold, loose brushstrokes emphasizing tracks behind creature — clear prints becoming vague becoming nothing, horizon fading into sameness at the edges. The creature's head turns toward the dens. One eye is still an eye. The other is becoming suggestion.
```

**Loci to find:**
1. Creature's forelimbs, claws gripping (foreground left)
2. Creature's softening midsection (foreground center)
3. Tracks behind — clear to vague to nothing (foreground right)
4. The creature's dissolving head (middle)
5. The dens itself — gray, patient, offering (background left)
6. The uncertain boundary line (background center)

## Evaluation Criteria

After generating each image, test against:

### 1. Watch Test
Does the image feel observed? Is there awareness in the scene?
- Yeller sighting: The five figures watching
- Scavenger: The darkness beyond lantern
- Wet boots: The dens through the tent gap
- Five women: Walking toward something that waits
- Archive: The stacks thinking
- Creature: The dens offering

### 2. Murk Test
Is anything hidden? Does darkness have presence?
- Look for: edges dissolving, details fading, darkness with texture

### 3. Weight Test
Does atmosphere have mass? Does light press rather than illuminate?
- Look for: heavy shadows, light that stops, amber/gray weight

### 4. Uncanny Test
Is something wrong or too still?
- Yeller: synchronized movement
- Scavenger: sorting bones by rules older than language
- Wet boots: moisture that shouldn't be there
- Five women: five bodies one motion
- Archive: ink wet after a century
- Creature: form forgetting itself

### 5. Loci Test
Can you find 6 distinct mnemonic objects?
- Must be findable even in murk
- Should emerge from darkness rather than sit on clean background

## Notes for Generation

**Generator:** Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image with Thinking)

**If images are too dark:** Add "with [object] emerging clearly from the darkness" for key loci

**If images are too clean:** Emphasize "rough crosshatching," "loose brushstrokes," "fading into darkness"

**If images feel Earth-like:** Remove any accidentally specific architecture, add Densworld-specific elements (three-direction compass, prime-number groupings, the dens texture)
