# Compromise Test: Densworld Field Sketch Style

**Balancing atmospheric murk with mnemonic clarity**

---

## The Problem

- **Image 1 (ChatGPT):** Good object clarity, but atmosphere too clean/illustrative
- **Image 2 (Gemini):** Excellent atmosphere, but crosshatching obscures loci

## The Goal

Atmospheric weight and watching quality of Image 2 + object findability of Image 1

## Test Prompt: Grigsu's Yeller Sighting (Revised)

```
Densworld field sketch: Ridge at Yeller Quarry at dusk. Watercolor wash of amber and rust dominating the sky, bleeding into heavy gray-purple clouds. The distant ridge and rock faces rendered in loose crosshatching that dissolves into atmospheric murk.

In the foreground, six objects rendered with cleaner, sharper ink lines emerging clearly from the textured ground:

1. A leather field journal lying open on flat stone — pages visible, dark binding crisp against rock
2. A brass spyglass resting against a canvas pack — metallic gleam, distinct cylindrical shape
3. A three-direction compass on leather cord — circular face readable, no east marking
4. A dented water canteen half-buried in quarry dust — clear silhouette
5. A coiled rope with frayed end — the coil's shape distinct, texture suggested
6. An unlit lantern set on bare ground — glass and metal frame sharp against earth

The camp tents in middle distance rendered softer, part of the atmospheric texture.

On the far ridge, five women stand in perfect alignment, backlit by dying amber sun. Silhouettes only — too distant for features, but clearly five, clearly watching, clearly still. The amber glow halos them. They are looking this direction.

Background: murky, crosshatched, dissolving at edges.
Foreground objects: clean lines, findable, emerging from the murk.
No border, no caption, no text in the image.

## What's Different

| Element | Old Prompt | New Prompt |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Style name | "Urban sketch style" | "Densworld field sketch" |
| Crosshatching | Everywhere | "Background and shadows only" |
| Objects | Described in scene | Listed explicitly as "cleaner, sharper ink lines" |
| Instruction | Implicit | Explicit: "emerging clearly from the textured ground" |
| Final instruction | None | "Foreground objects: clean lines, findable" |

## Alternate Versions to Test

### Version A: More Explicit Object Isolation
Add at end:
```
The six foreground objects should read as distinct shapes even in thumbnail.
Render them with confident ink lines while the surrounding ground remains
textured and atmospheric.
```

### Version B: Silhouette Emphasis
Add to object descriptions:
```
Each object rendered as a clear dark silhouette with minimal internal
detail but unmistakable shape.
```

### Version C: Light on Objects
Add:
```
A weak secondary light source from the camp area picks out the six
foreground objects, giving them slightly more definition than the
surrounding murk.
```

## Evaluation

After generating, check:

1. **Can you find all 6 objects in 3 seconds?** (Loci test)
2. **Does the background still have weight/murk?** (Atmosphere test)
3. **Are the five figures watching?** (Uncanny test)
4. **Does amber dominate as atmosphere, not accent?** (Color test)
5. **Would this work as a memory palace?** (Mnemonotechnical test)

## Notes

- Try in both ChatGPT and Gemini
- If ChatGPT is too clean, add more atmospheric language
- If Gemini is too murky, emphasize "cleaner lines" and "emerging clearly"
- The explicit numbered list of objects may help the generator understand what needs clarity

*Generate and compare. We're looking for the sweet spot.*
